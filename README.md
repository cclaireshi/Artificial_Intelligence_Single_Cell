# Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cell Type Classification with Deep Neural Networks

We aim to build a deep neural network model to help identify the cell types in the bone marrow mononuclear cells.
 
 
 # Background
Single cell sequencing is an emerging and revolutionary technology to identify different cell types and characterize the landscape of individual cell. Deep learning is making major advances in solving real-world problems in the wide artificial intelligence (AI) community. It is expected that we are able to identify the characteristics of  different cell types by leveraging the power from deep learning algorithms.

# Softwares
 
- Python3
- TensorFlow3
- Sklearn

# Instructions
We provide instructions for running our model including data preprocessing, model training, and model test.
